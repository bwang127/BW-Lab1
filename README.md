# Visualization
I want to move the pictures upwards to be in line with the top fact box

Second link to show "Image Courtesy of: link" without the whole thing being linked

Both links to line up with the pictures

When I hit the button, it slightly pushes down the pictures for the first fact

I previously arranged it so that the left side was one div and the right side was another div but when I did that, the images would push down for every fact when hitting the button
